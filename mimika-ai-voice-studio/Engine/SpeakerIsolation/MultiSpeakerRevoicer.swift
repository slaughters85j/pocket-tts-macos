//  Bridges Speaker Isolation → Voice Changer. Phase 7 stereo bed architecture: instead of summing per-speaker isolated mono tracks, the final mix is computed from a stereo `vocalsBed` + a stereo `musicBed`. Per-speaker actions modify the bed in place:
//
//      * `.useOriginal`  → no modification (speaker's content stays in vocalsBed at native level).
//      * `.discard`      → zero out the speaker's segmentRanges in vocalsBed (silences them in the final).
//      * `.revoice`      → zero out segmentRanges + sum TTS overlay (mono 24 kHz from TTS, resampled to bedSampleRate, duplicated to L+R).
//
//  Background row (`speakerID == backgroundSpeakerID`):
//      * `.useOriginal`  → musicBed contributes to final.
//      * `.discard`      → musicBed dropped from final.
//      * `.revoice`      → N/A (UI hides this for the Background row).
//
//  Final = (modified vocalsBed) + (musicBed if not discarded)
//          → per-channel soft-clip to ±1.
//
//  Why bed-based (vs. summing isolated rows):
//      When ALL rows are `.useOriginal`, the per-row-sum approach reconstructs the original mix via summed per-channel mono slices, which lose ~3 dB on uncorrelated stereo content via the `(L+R)/2` downmix. Codex measured this against the Paul Wall test clip: summed mono rows landed ~5 LU under the source; raw stereo `vocals + music` reconstruction landed within 0.66 LU. Bed-based mix collapses the all-`.useOriginal` case to literally `vocalsBed + musicBed`, matching the raw-stem reconstruction. Only discarded / revoiced speakers surgically modify the bed.
//
//  AP-off (v1) compatibility:
//      With Audio Preservation disabled, the VM passes `vocalsBed` = the original mono 24 kHz mix and `musicBed` = nil (no separation happened). The same code path then:
//          - `.useOriginal` keeps the speaker's audio in vocalsBed
//          - `.discard` silences segmentRanges (including any music underneath — the v1 behavior)
//          - `.revoice` silences segmentRanges + adds TTS
//          - musicBed is nil so nothing else is added
//      Output is mono 24 kHz, identical to the v1 per-row-sum behavior, no regression.
