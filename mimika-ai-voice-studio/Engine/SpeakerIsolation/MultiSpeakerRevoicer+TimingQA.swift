//  Timing-QA adaptive re-render loop for the re-voice path. Sibling file to MultiSpeakerRevoicer.swift (same actor) — split out per the file-size guideline. Owns ALL of the drift-cap tuning: the caps, the re-coalesce gap, and the tolerance live here as the single source of truth, so callers construct an untuned STT and never duplicate them.

    /// Segment-duration caps tried in order by the adaptive re-render loop. The timeline renderer only pins each segment's START, so a long sentence lets the new voice's pacing drift from the original (~0.2 s per second of sentence — measured at up to ~1.9 s on a 7 s utterance). Shorter caps bound that intra-segment drift at the cost of more synthesis boundaries.

    ///
    /// Render selection, per MEASURED iteration: fewest dropped words first — a truncated tail is a worse artifact than a late one — then smallest max offset. An iteration whose QA transcription failed or matched nothing carries no evidence: it can neither be selected as best nor end the loop. If NO iteration measures, the first render is returned as the last-resort fallback.

    /// The QA report is logged for dev only — it is NOT surfaced in the UI. Cost: the first render + one STT-of-output pass always run (head/tail silence is trimmed before that STT, so on multi-speaker files the pass covers this speaker's extent, not the whole file); finer re-renders fire only when the measured timing was off.
