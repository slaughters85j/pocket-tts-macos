//  Deterministic, seedable RandomNumberGenerator for reproducible TTS noise sampling. The pocket-tts AR loop draws a per-frame truncated-normal noise vector; driving that draw from a fixed seed makes a synthesis fully reproducible across launches (same seed + same text → same audio). See TTSEngine.sampleTruncNormal and SynthesisOptions.seed.

/// SplitMix64 PRNG. Chosen for being tiny, fast, and stateless beyond a single UInt64 — ideal for deterministic seeding. Passes the standard SplitMix64 test vectors; more than adequate for driving Box-Muller noise on the synthesis path (this is not a cryptographic context).
