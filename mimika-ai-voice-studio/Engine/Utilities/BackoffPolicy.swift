//  Configurable retry schedule used by `DemucsModelManager`'s download loop. Lifted to its own file (rather than living next to the manager) so tests can construct instantaneous-retry policies without subclassing the manager, and so a future downloader for any other asset class can reuse the same vocabulary.
