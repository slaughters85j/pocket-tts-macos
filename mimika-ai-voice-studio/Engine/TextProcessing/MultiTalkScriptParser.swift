//  MultiTalkScriptParser.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Parses Multi-Talk scripts of the form:
//
//      {Alice} Hi there. [1.5s] {Bob} Hi back. How are you today?
//
//  into a sequence of `Chunk`s that the engine can render: each text chunk is bound to one speaker, each pause chunk to a duration in seconds.
//
//  Rules:
//    * `{Name}` switches the active speaker. Text before the first `{Name}` uses the script's default speaker (the first one defined).
//    * `[Xs]` (X is a decimal number, e.g. "1.5") inserts a pause. Whitespace around the marker is trimmed.
//    * Unknown speaker names are surfaced as `.unknownSpeaker(name:)` chunks so the engine can show a sensible error.
//    * Multiple consecutive pauses are preserved as separate `.pause(d)` chunks.

The first speaker becomes the "default" used before any `{Name}` tag. `voiceNameForVoiceID` (optional) registers each speaker's voice display name as a second alias, so the parser resolves `{Voice Name}` tags in addition to `{Speaker label}` tags. Used by the tag-mode picker in Multi-Talk — when the user toggles to "Voice names", the rewriter swaps the tag text and the parser still matches because both forms are registered.
