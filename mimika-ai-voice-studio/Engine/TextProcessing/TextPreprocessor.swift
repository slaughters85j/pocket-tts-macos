//  Per-chunk text prep that mirrors Python pocket-tts's `prepare_text_prompt` (`pocket_tts/models/tts_model.py:824`). Applied to each sentence chunk right before tokenization so:
//
//    1. Whitespace is collapsed (\n\r → " ", double-space → single, one pass).
//    2. The chunk starts with an uppercase letter — gives the model a clean sentence-start cue.
//    3. The chunk ends with terminal punctuation. If it currently ends in a letter or digit we append "." so the model has an EOS anchor.
//    4. Very short chunks (<5 words) get 8 leading spaces, per the Python author's note: "The model does not perform well when there are very few tokens, so we can add empty spaces at the beginning to increase the token count."
//    5. `framesAfterEosGuess` is 3 for ≤4-word chunks, else 1 — used by the caller as `framesAfterEOS = framesAfterEosGuess + 2`, matching the Python pipeline's `frames_after_eos_guess += 2` line.
//
//  Divergence from Python (intentional): Python computes the prepared text in `_generate_audio_stream` (`tts_model.py:532`) but then passes the raw `sentence` to the model instead of the prepared text — so the 8-space pad and capitalize/append-period transforms never actually reach the tokenizer in Python. We honor the author's stated intent and apply the transforms in Swift.
