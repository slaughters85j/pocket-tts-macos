//  Per-voice RMS target resolution and gain application (P1-N1).
//
//  Background: every imported voice's reference WAV is RMS-normalized to -16 dB at import time (`VoiceManager.rmsNormalizeWAV`). That value is also what Python's `_normalize_audio_rms` uses as default. So the engine's output, while not strictly guaranteed to land at -16 dB, is conditioned on a -16 dB prompt and lands close enough to make a -16 dB BASELINE the right scaling reference.
//
//  The slider in the Voice Manager lets the user offset that. A voice configured for -10 dB plays ~6 dB louder than baseline; a voice configured for -22 dB plays ~6 dB quieter. Multi-Talk's strategy picker reuses the same per-voice target with three combining rules.
//
//  This is a streaming-friendly static-gain approach. A measure-then-normalize pass would be more precise but requires the whole buffer, which would defeat the streaming player. See FIDELITY_BACKLOG P1-N1 for the documented trade-off.
