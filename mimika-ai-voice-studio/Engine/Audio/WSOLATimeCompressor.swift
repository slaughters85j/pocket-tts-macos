//
//  Pitch-preserving time-compression via WSOLA (Waveform-Similarity-based Overlap-Add; Verhelst & Roelands, 1993). Used by TimelineAlignedRenderer to shrink synthesized speech that overshoots its source-timed slot, so the new voice lands within the original timing instead of being clipped mid-syllable.
//
//  Algorithm:
//    1. Read fixed-size analysis windows from the input. Window k's target start in the input is `k * analysisHop` where `analysisHop = synthesisHop * ratio`. For compression (ratio > 1), analysisHop > synthesisHop — we step through the input faster than we step through the output, dropping some portion of the signal in each window pair's overlap.
//    2. Search ±toleranceSamples around the target start for the position whose waveform best matches the NATURAL CONTINUATION of the previously chosen window (the unwindowed input at previousChosenStart + synthesisHop), scored by cross-correlation (vDSP_dotpr). This snap-to-similar-phase step is what distinguishes WSOLA from plain SOLA — it aligns windows at pitch-period boundaries so the output's fundamental is preserved (no chipmunk-ification).
//    3. Multiply the chosen input slice by a Hann taper (vDSP_vmul), then overlap-add into the output buffer at `k * synthesisHop`. Track the sum of window weights at each output sample so we can normalize at the end — guards against amplitude ripple where the Hann-sum dips below 1.0 at the boundaries.
//
//  Quality envelope on 24 kHz speech (Mimi/Kyutai output):
//    * 1.05–1.30× compression: near-transparent. Voice timbre + pitch survive; total duration shrinks.
//    * 1.30–1.60×: subtle metallic edge on sustained vowels; transient preservation starts to wobble. The renderer's gate caps at 1.30× for this reason and falls back to clip-with-fade above 1.60×.
//    * Beyond 1.60×: not handled here — the caller decides whether to attempt or fall back.

Voice onsets are transient/unvoiced and have no periodic structure for the correlation search to align on, so compressing them produces the audible "scratchy line front" artifact; steady voiced speech mid-line survives compression nearly transparently. Protecting the onset shifts ALL of the compression into the remainder (whose effective ratio rises slightly — e.g. a 1.30× request on a 2 s segment with a 200 ms guard compresses the remainder at ~1.35×). The guard is auto-shrunk when the requested ratio leaves too little remainder to absorb it. Output length is UNCHANGED by the guard. Default 0 (previous behavior).
