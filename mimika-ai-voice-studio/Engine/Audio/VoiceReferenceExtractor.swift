//  WP-VMI-2. Turns an isolated speaker track (silence-padded, mono) into a compact voice-reference clip for the custom-voice import flow — the "behind the scenes processing" between picking a speaker in the voice-from-video step and landing on the Save Voice Preset view.

import Foundation

/// Pure helpers that collapse an isolated speaker buffer into a back-to-back speech clip suitable as a cloning reference:
///   * silence gaps (the exact-zero regions the isolator writes between a speaker's utterances) are removed
///   * segments are joined with a short linear crossfade so the hard zero-boundary cuts don't click (clicks poison the KV bake)
///   * output is capped (default 30 s) — `PocketTTSVoiceEncoder` uses at most the first 15 s anyway; the cap keeps saved WAVs small

    /// Zero-runs shorter than this are treated as speech, not gaps — a lone exact-0.0 sample can occur inside real audio and must not split a segment (and insert a crossfade) mid-word. Isolator gaps are other speakers' turns, comfortably longer than this.
