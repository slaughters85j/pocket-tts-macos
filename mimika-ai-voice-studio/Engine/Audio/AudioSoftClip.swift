//  AudioSoftClip.swift

//
//  Piecewise soft-clip used by anything that sums or amplifies audio and needs to ride the rail without the audible "pop" of a brick-wall hard clip.
//
//  Curve:
//      |x| ≤ knee (= 0.9)  → output = x  (identity — no coloration)
//      |x| > knee          → output = sign(x) * (
//          knee + (1 - knee) * tanh((|x| - knee) / (1 - knee))
//      )
//
//  Why identity below the knee: a global `tanh(x * 0.9)` curve attenuates IN-RANGE samples by 10-20%, which Phase 7 verified was audible as a loss of brightness on quiet content. The piecewise shape leaves typical samples untouched and only folds the overload region — same approach used by analog "soft limiters."
//
//  Shared by:
//    * VoiceEnhancer.rmsNormalize (Phase 10 / Commit 7)
//    * MultiSpeakerRevoicer.softClip is the equivalent inline helper from Phase 7 that motivated this extraction. We could later route Phase 7's copy through here too, but that means touching reviewed code so it is deliberately deferred.
