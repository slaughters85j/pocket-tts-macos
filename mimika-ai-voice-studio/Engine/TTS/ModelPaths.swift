//
//   * Core ML mlpackages (prompt_phase, calm_stateful, mimi_stateful, voice_prompt_phase) — published on `slaughters85j/pocket-tts-coreml`; compiled + installed as `<rawValue>.mlmodelc` under `installed/<rawValue>-v1/<rawValue>.mlmodelc/`.
//
//   * Stock assets (tokenizer.model, tokenizer_vocab.json, the seven stock voice KV state safetensors) — published on `slaughters85j/pocket-tts-stock-assets`; unzipped flat into `installed/stock_assets-v1/`. Same lifecycle, no compile step.
//
// The Bundle.main fallback exists so a future build that chose to re-bundle anything would keep working unchanged. Today the bundle is empty for all of these — first launch is download-only.
