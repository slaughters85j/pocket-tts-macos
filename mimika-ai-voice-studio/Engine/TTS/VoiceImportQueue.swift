//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  WP-VMI-1. Serial FIFO queue for voice import / enhance / encode jobs.
//
//  Replaces the old single-slot `inFlightVoiceImportTask` in ContentView, whose cancel-on-new behavior meant every new import cancelled the previous voice's Fish encode + Pocket-TTS KV bake. Rapid back-to-back imports left earlier voices half-encoded ("Partial" badge, missing KV), and the Voice Manager recovery pass had the same flaw — it fired one encode per incomplete voice in a loop, each cancelling the one before, so each app session healed exactly ONE voice.
//
//  The queue owns ORDER and CANCELLATION only. The actual pipeline (LavaSR enhance / Fish encode / KV bake) is injected as `executor`, so the mechanics are unit-testable without Core ML.

import Foundation
import Observation

/// Serial FIFO queue for voice import jobs.
///
/// Semantics:
///   * Jobs for DIFFERENT voices run strictly FIFO, one at a time.
///   * Enqueueing a job for a voice that already has a pending job REPLACES that pending job (newest intent wins), and cancels the active job if it is for the same voice — preserving the old single-voice behaviors (double-click Enhance, reject-then-re-encode).
///   * `cancel(voiceID:)` removes that voice's pending job and cancels the active job if it is that voice. Other queued voices are unaffected.
///   * `onDrain` fires once when the queue empties (used to unload Fish once per batch instead of once per voice).
