//  DemucsModelVariant.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Catalog of HTDemucs Core ML model variants the Speaker Isolator's source-separation pipeline can use. v1 ships ONE variant — `.htdemucs` — and the picker UI is single-row by design. The enum exists anyway (instead of a string constant) so:
//    * `DemucsModelManager` has a typed catalog to iterate when rescanning the install dir,
//    * future drops (`htdemucs_ft`, `htdemucs_6s`) can be appended without touching the manager's call-sites, and
//    * UserDefaults round-trip for "active separator variant" works via the raw value.
//
//  Each variant carries the metadata `DemucsModelManager` and the upcoming "Manage Separation Models…" sheet read at runtime:
//    * `huggingFaceURL`  — published mlpackage zip
//    * `expectedSHA256`  — verified against the downloaded bytes
//    * `approxSize`      — UI hint (Manage Models row)
//    * `version`         — folder-suffix on the install dir so a future re-published model can land alongside the older one (mirrors the versioned-install requirement from the Phase 7 plan).
