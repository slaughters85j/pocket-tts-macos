//  Pure-function utilities for the HTDemucs chunked-inference loop in `DemucsSourceSeparator`. HTDemucs's exported Core ML model takes a fixed-shape input (`[1, 2, 343980]` stereo Float32 = 7.8 s at 44.1 kHz), so any clip longer than that has to be split into overlapping chunks and stitched back together. The split + stitch logic lives here so it's testable WITHOUT loading the 400 MB mlpackage and WITHOUT depending on Core ML at all.
//
//  Pipeline shape per chunk (driven by `DemucsSourceSeparator`):
//
//      1. `chunkOffsets` carves the full input into [start,end) frame ranges with `overlap` frames of mutual overlap so the boundary discontinuity from HTDemucs's window edges gets smoothed out by the overlap-add step.
//      2. Separator runs Core ML on each chunk, gets a `[1,8,T]` output, slices it per `DemucsStemMap`.
//      3. The downsampled+downmixed mono chunk is multiplied by a triangular window from `triangularWindow` and *summed* into the growing master via `overlapAdd`. Triangular windowing means consecutive overlapping windows sum to a constant 1.0 across their entire span — no amplitude dips at the boundary, no need to renormalize.
//
//  The functions are `static` on an enum (instead of free funcs) for the conventional Swift namespacing without a constructor — same shape as `SpeakerIsolator`.
