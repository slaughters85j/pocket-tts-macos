//
//  State + error enums for `DemucsModelManager`, split into their own file so the manager stays focused on the singleton + download flow. Lives in a separate file because:
//    * `DownloadState` is referenced by the (future) Manage Separation Models sheet view, and pulling that file into a UI module shouldn't drag the entire @MainActor manager with it.
//    * `ManagerError` is surfaced by the manager's public API; callers `as?`-cast against these cases and benefit from having them right next to the state vocabulary.
