//  Channel-layout constants for the converted HTDemucs Core ML `mlpackage`. The PyTorch model returns a 4-D tensor of shape `[B, S, C, T]` (batch × stems × channels × time); for Core ML conversion we wrap it in a flatten module that reshapes to `[B, S * C, T]` so the output stays a simple 3-D tensor that `MLMultiArray` can vend without nested dimensions. After the flatten, `S × C = 4 × 2 = 8` channels are packed into dim 1 in fixed source order:
//
//      channels 0,1 → drums  (L, R)
//      channels 2,3 → bass   (L, R)
//      channels 4,5 → other  (L, R)
//      channels 6,7 → vocals (L, R)
//
//  This ordering is baked into the conversion script (`pocket-tts-demucs-coreml-conversion/scripts/02c_convert_surgical_patch.py`, `HTDemucsExport` wrapper). Any change there MUST be mirrored here, or `DemucsSourceSeparator` will silently route the wrong stems into the vocals + music outputs and the entire pipeline will feed background music into the diarizer instead of voices.
//
//  Lifted into its own enum (instead of `private static let` constants inside `DemucsSourceSeparator`) so:
//    * the test target can reference the constants without `@testable` shenanigans, and
//    * a future MLX or MPSGraph-based separator can reuse the same channel ordering without copy-pasting the magic numbers.
