//  DiarizationProvider.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Pluggable speaker-diarization interface used by SpeakerIsolator and MultiSpeakerRevoicer. Mirrors `STTProvider`'s shape: implementations pick the backend (SpeakerKit pyannote, future alternatives) and the caller only handles the timestamped segments coming back.
//
//  Contract:
//    * `diarize` returns segments in chronological order (sorted by startSec).
//    * Each segment's `startSec` / `endSec` is measured from t=0 of the input audio file.
//    * Empty input audio → empty array (NOT an error).
//    * `speakerID` strings are stable for the duration of one `diarize(_:)` call — the same speaker keeps the same label across all of their segments — but identifiers are NOT portable across calls (SPEAKER_00 in one run may be a different person from SPEAKER_00 in another).
//    * Implementations MAY require an out-of-band model download before the first call. Callers should invoke `ensureModelsReady(progress:)` first if the implementation exposes it.

import Foundation

// MARK: - DiarizationSettings
//
// Backend-agnostic tuning knobs surfaced by the Speaker Isolator UI. The defaults match each backend's out-of-the-box behavior — i.e. passing `DiarizationSettings()` should produce identical output to passing nothing at all.
//
// Backed today by SpeakerKit/pyannote, which maps these onto:
//   * sensitivity        → clusterDistanceThreshold (lower threshold = more aggressive splits, so high sensitivity ⇒ low threshold)
//   * numberOfSpeakers   → numberOfSpeakers (nil = auto-detect)
//
// The mapping lives in `SpeakerKitDiarizationProvider`; this struct keeps the units neutral so future backends can interpret them in whatever way makes sense for their algorithm.

// `nonisolated` because the project default is `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` — without the opt-out this struct would silently inherit MainActor isolation, blocking `actor SpeakerKitDiarizationProvider` (which is its primary consumer) from touching it without a hop. The struct is pure value-type arithmetic; isolation is overkill.
nonisolated struct DiarizationSettings: Sendable, Equatable {
    /// Force the diarizer to find exactly this many speakers. `nil` means auto-detect. Useful when the user knows the speaker count up front (e.g. an interview with N panelists) and the auto-detect heuristic is splitting or merging incorrectly.

    /// 0.0 ... 1.0. Higher = more aggressive about splitting voices into separate speakers (good when two distinct people are being merged into one cluster). Lower = more aggressive about merging similar voices (good when one person is being split across multiple clusters due to varying pitch / volume). 0.5 maps to the pyannote default (clusterDistanceThreshold=0.6).

The old map set the raw threshold without that compensation, which pushed the merge half of the slider's effective gate past ~1.0 — a "never split" ceiling for unit-normalized embeddings — so roughly the bottom quarter of the slider travel did nothing.

    ///   sensitivity 1.0 (Split more) → 0.62  aggressive split
    ///
    /// Higher sensitivity ⇒ lower gate ⇒ embeddings must be closer to be treated as the same speaker ⇒ more speakers.
