//  SpeechFrameworkSTT.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Reference / fallback STTProvider built on Apple's `Speech` framework (`SFSpeechRecognizer`). The production Voice Changer path now uses FluidAudio / Parakeet; this stays as the Apple Speech backend for reference and possible fallback use.
//
//  Notes:
//    * `Speech` capability + `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` are already in place for the live-mic DictationController flow; file-based recognition reuses the same auth path.
//    * `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true` keeps audio off Apple's servers; requires the locale's offline model installed via Settings → General → Language & Region. When unavailable, `recognitionTask` errors with `.serverFallbackDisallowed` and we surface that to the user.
//    * SFTranscriptionSegment is WORD-level. We coalesce consecutive words whose inter-word gap is below `utteranceGapSec` into a single TranscribedSegment, so the downstream `[Xs]` pause markers land between natural utterances rather than between every word.

Defaults to `" "` for the original word-level callers (Apple Speech-style spans) whose spans are bare words without embedded whitespace. Pass `""` for SentencePiece-style sub-word token callers (FluidAudio / Parakeet) whose spans already encode word boundaries via a leading space on word-start tokens — adding another space between them would double-space and turn "▁eat" + "ing" into "eat ing" instead of "eating".

When set, a long uninterrupted run is split at the next WORD-START token once it would exceed the cap, EVEN with no pause (a capped segment may overrun by the remainder of one word — never split mid-word). Used by the re-voice path: the timeline renderer only pins each segment's START, so a long sentence lets the new voice's word pacing drift from the original the longer it runs (measured at ~0.2 s drift per second of sentence). Capping segment length bounds that intra-segment drift. `nil` (the default) keeps the old behavior for dictation / pause-marker callers, which want natural utterance-length segments.
