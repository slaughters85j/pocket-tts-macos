//
//  Single transcribed utterance with timing in seconds. Mirrors the unit pyannote's `Annotation.itertracks()` yields (turn.start / turn.end). Used by the Voice Changer pipeline as the contract between any STTProvider (FluidAudio, Apple Speech, etc.) and the silence-preserving script builder.
//
//  `speaker` is optional because Voice Changer v1 is single-speaker only; populating it from a diarization step (SpeakerKit / pyannote) is the planned extension path for multi-speaker support.
