//  FluidAudioDiarizationProvider.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  DiarizationProvider backed by FluidInference's FluidAudio. Replaces the SpeakerKit/pyannote-VBx provider in Phase 8. Same vendor as `FluidAudioSTT` so the whole Speaker Isolation pipeline is now served by one Core ML stack instead of two (WhisperKit + SpeakerKit).
//
//  Replaced SpeakerKit because its `clusterDistanceThreshold` was only a hint that VBx's variational-Bayes loop overrode on its own convergence criteria — the sensitivity slider did nothing on hard content, and VBx's real hyperparameters were not exposed. FluidAudio applies `DiarizerConfig.clusteringThreshold` directly in the clustering step, so the slider works end to end.
//
//  `DiarizerManager.initialize(models:)` is synchronous and `consuming`, so models cannot be shared across managers — a settings change forces a manager rebuild. `performCompleteDiarization` is synchronous and takes 16 kHz mono Float32 from `AudioFileLoader.load(url, targetSampleRate: 16_000)`.
//
//  Input is AGC pre-boosted to ~-20 dBFS RMS, same as the STT path. Quiet audio (broadcast dialog under -35 LUFS, post-separation vocals stems) embeds near the model's noise prior, where distinct voices look too close together and get merged.
