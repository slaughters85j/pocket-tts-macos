//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Driver for the "Change Voices…" button — runs the MultiSpeakerRevoicer pipeline, then either saves the combined audio as WAV or re-encodes into the original video as .mp4.
//
//  Extracted from the main VM file so that file can stay focused on state + the isolate-and-display orchestration. The revoice/save logic is logically separate (different entry point, different output, different cancellation semantics).

    ///   - cacheKey: Stable identifier for the supplied STT (e.g. `"fluidaudio-parakeet-v3"`). Subsequent invocations with the same `cacheKey` reuse the cached STT instance — and therefore its already-loaded model — instead of paying the load cost again.
