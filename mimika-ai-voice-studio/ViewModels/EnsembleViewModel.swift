//
//  EnsembleViewModel.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Drives Ensemble Mode: a cast of personas plus the user hold one shared,
//  autonomous conversation. Each turn runs through the shared SpokenTurnRunner
//  (the same LLM -> SentenceDetector -> TTS -> player pipeline the solo Chat
//  uses), with the speaker rotated by the Conductor and the transcript rendered
//  from each speaker's point of view (see EnsembleViewModel+Context).
//
//  Phase 1 is TEXT ONLY (runner `speak: false`) with a hardcoded demo cast and
//  manual step-through; voices, autonomous playback, interruption, context
//  windowing, and export arrive in later phases.
//
//  Loop ownership: a single @MainActor `loopTask` owns the run. Each turn is
//  awaited fully (the conversation is a dependency chain — turn N+1 needs N),
//  so the loop never picks a new speaker mid-turn. All transcript state lives
//  on the main actor.
