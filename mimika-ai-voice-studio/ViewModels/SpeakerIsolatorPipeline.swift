//
//  Actor that owns the engine dependencies (loader, diarizer, source separator, revoicer, muxer) and exposes the speaker-isolation pipeline as a set of focused phase methods. The view model orchestrates phases + drives UI state; this type is the worker that knows how to actually run them.
//
//  Why an actor rather than an enum-of-statics:
//    * The pipeline holds references to long-lived engines (the diarizer caches its model, the separator caches its MLModel) — they're not free to construct. Sharing those across multiple phase calls means the type needs identity.
//    * Phase methods are async (each one hops to an underlying actor or off-main worker anyway). Co-locating them in an actor makes the isolation story uniform.
//    * Cancellation propagates naturally — `Task.cancel()` from the VM's `inflightTask` cancels in-flight phases without special plumbing.
//
//  Why not move the orchestration loop in here too?
//    * The VM mutates `@Observable` state (`status`, `speakers`) between phases. Putting orchestration in an actor would force a MainActor hop per state update, gaining nothing and losing the simple top-to-bottom narrative the VM has.
