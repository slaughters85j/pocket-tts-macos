Without the fingerprint here, SwiftUI's diff returns "equal" and skips SpeakerRow re-render — which means MiniAudioPlayer's `.id(...)` modifier never re-evaluates and its temp-WAV-cached AVAudioPlayer keeps playing the stale step-6 (mix-contaminated) audio. The bug manifested as: per-row preview sounds contaminated until the user changes any UI field (which DID change Equatable's result) at which point the player rebuilds with the clean post-step-10 samples.
            //
