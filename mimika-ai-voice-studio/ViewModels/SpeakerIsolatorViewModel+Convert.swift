//
//  Orchestration for the `convertAndIsolate()` entry point — the full diarize → isolate → (optionally separate + re-isolate) pipeline. Extracted from the main VM file to keep that file focused on state + DI surface.
//
//  Diarize-first sequencing (per Codex F4): we run diarization FIRST on the original mix (~30 s for a 5-minute clip), populate the speakers table IMMEDIATELY so the user sees something while the rest of the pipeline runs, THEN — if Audio Preservation is enabled + the separator is wired up — we run HTDemucs in the background + re-isolate from the cleaner vocals stem.
//
//  This shape gives:
//    * Fast first-meaningful-paint: speakers populate ~30 s in.
//    * Optional quality improvement: cleaner stems + a Background row holding the music stem so it survives re-voicing.
//    * Graceful skip: with no separator wired or feature toggled off, the v1 behavior (mix-only) runs unchanged — regression test 3 locks this.

    // MARK: - Preview downmix helper

    /// Downmix a stereo AudioBuffer to mono + resample to `targetRate` for use in the preview UI's mono-only `SpeakerTrack.isolatedSamples` field. Used by step 9-10 of `convertAndIsolate` to turn the stereo HTDemucs stems into preview-friendly mono buffers WITHOUT touching the stereo beds stored on the VM (those are still used for the final mix; this helper only feeds the UI's per-row mini-player).
    ///
    /// Accepts mono OR stereo input — production stems are stereo 44.1 kHz; mock separators in tests may produce mono. Mono inputs skip the downmix; stereo inputs do `(L+R)/2`.

Mono of vocals stem barely loses level (vocals are mostly center-panned); mono of music stem loses ~3 dB on uncorrelated stereo content but that's fine for the preview row — the final mix uses the stereo bed directly via `MultiSpeakerRevoicer.revoice(vocalsBed:...)`.
