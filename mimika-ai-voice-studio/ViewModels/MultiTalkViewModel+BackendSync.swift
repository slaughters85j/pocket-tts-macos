//  mimika-ai-voice-studio
//
//  Backend-aware voice remapping + script-tag/display-mode reconciliation for Multi-Talk. Sibling file to MultiTalkViewModel.swift (which is over the file-size guideline).
//
//  Why this exists. Pocket-TTS and Fish use different voice-ID schemes ("cosette" / "imported:<UUID>" vs "fish-default" / raw "<UUID>"), and the script's {Tag} form depends on the Script Display mode plus the current speaker cards. Backend switches, Ensemble/History imports, and manual voice re-picks can each leave the three out of sync — cards holding IDs the active picker can't render (they show blank), and tags in a form the display mode no longer matches (no colors, no mode toggling). The helpers here are the single reconciliation surface all of those paths call.
