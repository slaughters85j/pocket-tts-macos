//  Turn-taking for Ensemble Mode. Pure + nonisolated so it's trivially unit-testable and free of any I/O for the "free" modes. Selection order:
//    1. Mention override (every mode honors it): if the last line directly addresses another cast member by name, that member goes next.
//    2. Mode-specific base selection: round-robin, or weighted-random (excluding the immediate last speaker so nobody answers themselves). Director mode does one LLM call per turn and is resolved by the view model; if it ever falls through to here it behaves as weighted-random.
