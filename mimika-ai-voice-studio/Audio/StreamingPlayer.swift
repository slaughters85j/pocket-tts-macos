// `@preconcurrency` downgrades Swift 6 Sendable warnings from AVFAudio types to nothing: Apple hasn't marked `AVAudioEngine` / `AVAudioPlayerNode` Sendable yet, but we capture them in the `controlQueue` hops below (the priority-inversion guard — see `controlQueue`), where the engine is only ever driven from that one serial queue. Matches the same opt-out used in Engine/VoiceChangerPipeline.swift for AVURLAsset.

// MARK: - StreamingPlayer
// Progressive playback of an AsyncStream<PCMFrame> through AVAudioEngine.
//
// Architecture:
//   PCMFrame (1920 Float32 @ 24 kHz mono, 80 ms)
//      → AVAudioPCMBuffer → AVAudioPlayerNode.scheduleBuffer (gap-free wall-clock scheduling) → AVAudioEngine.mainMixerNode (resamples to device format) → outputNode (speakers)
//
// AVAudioEngine bridges 24 kHz mono → device-native (typically 48 kHz stereo) at connection time, so we don't construct an AVAudioConverter manually. scheduleBuffer is documented thread-safe; per-frame allocation at 12.5 Hz is well within budget (engine produces ~3× real-time, so the player is always fed ahead of the audio clock).

(An earlier version pinned these at `.default` with `.enforceQoS`. That flag FORBIDS the priority boost, so it *guaranteed* the inversion whenever a `user-initiated` caller awaited the hop — confirmed by a QoS trace: caller 25, block 21. Suspending the actor via continuation does NOT break the QoS wait-for edge; the runtime still sees 25 waiting on 21.)
