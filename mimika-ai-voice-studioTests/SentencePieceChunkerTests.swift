//  SentencePieceChunkerTests.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studioTests
//
//  Validates the Swift port of Python `split_into_best_sentences` (tts_model.py:857). The chunker is the second-biggest contributor to the "longer sentences distort more" observation — it controls KV-cache resets and how much AR error can accumulate within one generation.
//
//  These tests are structural (boundary detection, chunk packing) rather than byte-for-byte parity against Python, because Python's `sp.decode` on a token slice can introduce minor whitespace differences from the original input and we don't try to match those literally.
