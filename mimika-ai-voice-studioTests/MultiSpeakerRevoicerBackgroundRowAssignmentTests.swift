//
//  MultiSpeakerRevoicerBackgroundRowAssignmentTests.swift
//  mimika-ai-voice-studioTests
//
//  Confirms the Codex F2 pattern: the Background SpeakerTrack produced by source-separation rides through `revoice` as just another `SpeakerAssignment` with `.useOriginal` disposition. `MultiSpeakerRevoicer.revoice` doesn't grow a new parameter for the music stem — it stays a list of equal-status assignments that get per-sample summed and soft-clipped.
//
//  This decoupling is important because it means:
//    * No special-case code paths for "music vs voice"
//    * The user can `.discard` the Background row and only the speakers stay (no extra UI plumbing needed)
//    * Tests can validate the sum / clip math without mocking out the TTS engine or STT — the `.useOriginal` path is pure data shuffling
