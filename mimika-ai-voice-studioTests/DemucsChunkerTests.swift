//  Pure-function tests for the chunk + window + overlap-add helpers in `DemucsChunker`. Crucial for shielding the `DemucsSourceSeparator` actor from regressions you can't easily see in a perceptual A/B — a 1% amplitude dip at chunk boundaries sounds fine on a single playback but adds up across a multi-minute clip into noticeable warble. The tests below catch that math drift without loading the 400 MB Core ML mlpackage.
//
//  Coverage matrix:
//     * chunkOffsets         — empty / single / multi / boundary
//     * triangularWindow     — shape, endpoints, COLA property
//     * overlapAdd           — sine-wave round-trip identity within 1e-6
