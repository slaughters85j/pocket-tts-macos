//  Tests the per-speaker dispatch + combine logic in MultiSpeakerRevoicer. The passthrough path (.useOriginal) is fully exercised against synthetic input. The revoice path uses mock STT + TTS engine implementations to verify the wiring without requiring real Core ML models / Apple Speech authorization.
