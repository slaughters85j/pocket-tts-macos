//
//  Phase 10 / Commit 7 — verifies `VoiceEnhancer.rmsNormalize` no longer brick-wall clips post-gain peaks, plus locks the underlying `AudioSoftClip` curve's two contractual properties:
//
//    1. In-range identity (|x| ≤ knee): output bit-for-bit equals input. The piecewise design makes this a property — any drift means a constant moved or the branch flipped.
//    2. Out-of-range asymptote: |output| < 1.0 monotonically as |input| grows; never reaches ±1.0 exactly, so no clipping cliff.
//
//  Plus an end-to-end RMS-normalize test that drives an overdriven buffer through the production code path and asserts no sample lands exactly at ±1 (which would have been the v1 hard-clip behavior).
//
//  Drives the helpers directly — no pipeline, no model, no MLX.
