//  CRITICAL REGRESSION 2 — re-scoped from "no musicStem param" to "no Background row" per Codex F2. The piecewise soft-clip introduced in Commit 7 (identity below the 0.9 knee, tanh-shaped folding above) preserves bit-for-bit v1 behavior on the entire in-range domain. The properties this file locks:
//
//    * Single-speaker @ ±0.7 amplitude: output EQUALS input sample-for-sample (within FP rounding). v1's hard-clip was also a no-op there; this is identity-preserving.
//    * Single-speaker assignment with NO Background row produces a single-track output (no music sum) — the Background-row-as-assignment pattern is OPTIONAL.
//    * Discarded speakers stay discarded; useOriginal speakers stay summed.
//
//  Above the knee (when accidental overlaps or summed Background push the master past ±0.9), the soft-clip folds smoothly toward ±1.0 — the audible win the soft-clip exists to deliver. v1's hard-clip would have chopped with a brick-wall "pop" at that boundary; the new curve doesn't.
