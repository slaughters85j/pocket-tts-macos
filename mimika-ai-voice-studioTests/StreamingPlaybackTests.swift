// `nonisolated` keeps this test off the main actor, so its synchronous `StreamingPlayer()` construction (engine attach/connect/prepare) doesn't run on the main thread. NOTE: XCTest still invokes `async` test methods at `user-initiated` QoS regardless of isolation, so this attribute does NOT lower the test's QoS. The priority inversion that used to fire here was fixed at the source — StreamingPlayer's awaited control-queue hops no longer pin themselves below the caller with `.enforceQoS` — not by changing test isolation.
