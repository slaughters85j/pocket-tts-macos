//  Smoke + sanity tests for `DemucsSourceSeparator`'s Core ML inference path. NOTE: these are NOT a real parity test against PyTorch yet — that test needs a separately-shipped INPUT-MIX fixture paired with the existing `htdemucs_vocals_golden.wav` vocals stem (which is the PyTorch reference OUTPUT). The conversion sub-project produced the golden vocals stem from a specific 10 s stereo input mix; that mix isn't in the test bundle yet, so we can't feed the same input to the Swift separator and assert it matches the same output.
//
//  TODO(phase7-followup): commit the input-mix fixture next to the golden vocals (small — ~1.7 MB stereo 16-bit @ 44.1 kHz × 10 s) and convert `test_separatorProducesOutput_fromGoldenVocals` into a true `test_vocalsStemMatchesGolden_fromInputMix` with the SI-SDR ≥ 22 dB gate the plan calls for.
//
//  Until that fixture lands, these tests catch:
//    * Model failed to load (loadModelIfNeeded throws)
//    * Inference returns wrong shape (validateOutputShape throws)
//    * Mono-input upmix path falls over
//    * Output amplitudes wildly out of range
//
//  All cases soft-skip via XCTSkip when the mlpackage isn't on disk — the test bundle deliberately doesn't vendor the 400 MB Core ML weights, so:
//    * Locally + after running the Manage Models sheet's "Download" button → tests light up.
//    * CI without the mlpackage → tests skip with a clear diagnostic line, suite still passes. The chunker / model-manager / variant tests (which DON'T need the model) run unconditionally.
