//
//  WP-VMI-2. Tests for VoiceReferenceExtractor — the pure helper that collapses an isolated speaker track (silence-padded with exact zeros between utterances) into a back-to-back voice-reference clip.
//
//  What we check:
//    * Speech-run detection: exact-zero gaps split, short zero runs (single zero-crossing samples) do NOT split
//    * Gap silence is fully removed from the output
//    * Segment joins are crossfaded (no step discontinuity)
//    * Output is capped at capSeconds
//    * Degenerate inputs (all silence, empty) return empty
