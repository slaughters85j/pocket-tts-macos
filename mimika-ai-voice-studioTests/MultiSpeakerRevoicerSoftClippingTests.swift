//
//  Curve tests for the `MultiSpeakerRevoicer.softClip(_:)` helper. Drives the static method directly — no pipeline, no engine, no STT. Validates the two properties the Phase 7 plan relies
//  on:
//
//    1. In-range linearity — samples within ±0.7 pass through within ~3% of their input value (no audible coloration on quiet content). The v1 hard-clip was a no-op for in-range samples; tanh's curve at 0 has slope 0.9 (because of the *0.9 input scale), so we accept a small coloration but document its bound.
//    2. Out-of-range asymptote — samples that exceed ±1.0 fold smoothly toward but never cross ±1.0. The function is monotonically increasing; doubling the input from 2.0 to 4.0 brings the output closer to the asymptote but not past it.
