# TODO — Work Packages

Working agreement: check this file before starting work; reference the WP# in
commits; a WP is only **Complete** after user validation.

## Current Focus

**WP-THREADS-1 — Solo & Ensemble cast threads + UI performance**
**Status:** In Progress (`feature/solo-and-ensemble-cast-threads`).

User-validated on the branch: app-wide SwiftUI layout stall, 1 Hz toolbar blink
and idle 30 fps redraw, test-suite data-integrity interlocks, sentence splitting
(`Lt.`), Markdown tables, thread rename, Ensemble transcript hover actions, skip
an invited Ensemble turn.

Awaiting validation: lazy Ensemble thread creation (an abandoned cast no longer
leaves an empty thread), async-only `ChatThreadStore` surface, tolerant decoding
for thread files, `EnsembleViewModel` task cancellation on deinit, context
metadata probed once per serving model instead of every second,
`SentencePieceTokenizerTests` moved from Swift Testing to XCTest,
`ChatViewChrome.swift` split out of `ChatView.swift`, `chatSettings` legacy-key
migration.

v1.5.11 shipped 2026-08-17 to the App Store. Earlier WPs unchanged: WP-CAST-1
needs user validation on `feature/export-import-cast`; WP-VMI-1/2/3 are COMPLETE
(user-validated) on `improved-custom-voice-import`; WP-VIT-3 (in-app editor) and
WP-VIT-4 (cleanup) remain open.

**Known debt, not scheduled:**

- TTS start latency — roughly half of turns begin speaking only when the streamed
  text is ~75% complete. Unresolved and unmeasured; needs timing instrumentation
  around `SentenceDetector` and `SpokenTurnRunner` before any further guessing.
- 400-line rule still broken: `EnsembleViewModel.swift` (1,464),
  `EnsembleSurfaceView.swift` (661), `ChatModels.swift` (436),
  `DirectorsChairPanel.swift` (429), `ChatView.swift` (422). Each needs an
  extension split, which is a larger refactor than this pass took on.
- Unexplained: Ensemble threads titled "New ensemble" with the hardcoded
  Ada / Bertrand `demoCast` appeared on app open. Creating path never found.

## WP-CAST-1 — Cast Import/Export, roster edit, grenade, Run Settings help

**Status:** Needs user validation.

1. **Export/Import cast JSON** from Cast & Settings (UUIDs, personas,
   scene/mood, run knobs). Import mints new store IDs; missing custom
   voices remap to `cosette`.
2. **Add/remove cast members** post-writer: green plus (Cosette / Strict /
   empty / cosette voice); xmark + confirmation; min 1 / max 8.
3. **Grenade prompt** upgraded to a hard bombshell injection; UI copy
   matches.
4. **Run Settings info.circles** on every knob; Turn order + Randomness
   help bodies switch with the current picker values.

## WP-VMI-3 — Enhancement Studio: premature toast + live-gain Play B

**Status:** COMPLETE (user-validated).

Two user-reported issues from the first enhanced import through the new
flow:

1. **Premature "ready for synthesis" toast.** The enhance pipeline must
   encode before the comparison screen enables Accept/Play, and the queue
   toasted after EVERY job — so the toast fired mid-audition, then again
   after Accept & Save's re-encode. Fix: only `.encode` jobs toast; every
   final path (plain import, Accept & Save, skip, reject-re-encode,
   orphan adoption) ends in one, so exactly one toast, at the right time.
2. **RMS slider was inaudible in the A/B and mislabeled.** Both files are
   normalized to −16 dB (import + enhancer — encoder-conditioning
   invariant, keep), and `rmsTargetDB` is a synthesis-time output gain
   (P1-N1), so the slider changed nothing on the comparison screen. Per
   user direction (FCP volume-slider model): **Play A** = untouched
   import baseline; **Play B** = enhanced track rendered through the
   CURRENT slider gain via `VoiceLevel.applyGain` — identical DSP to
   synthesis, so the preview is faithful.
3. **Peak-based headroom readout was degenerate** (user-caught: "always
   says −16"). `VoiceEnhancer.rmsNormalize` soft-clips peaks up against
   full scale, so measured peak ≈ 1.0 for EVERY enhanced voice and
   "clipping starts above −16 dB" always. Two-part fix:
   * `VoiceLevel.applyGain` overload stage switched from brick-wall
     clamp to the shared piecewise `AudioSoftClip` (identity below the
     0.9 knee, tanh fold above) — boosting now behaves like an analog
     limiter instead of flat-topping; stateless, streaming-safe;
     strictly better sound for any voice already configured > −16.
   * Readout switched from binary peak-clipping to a live magnitude-
     histogram metric (`ClipHeadroom` in VoiceLevel.swift): % of samples
     the limiter touches at the current level, tiered clean → light
     (≤1%) → audition (≤5%) → heavy (red, >5%).

## WP-VMI-2 — Voice from video (extract a custom voice via speaker isolation)

**Status:** COMPLETE (user-validated — "that worked really well").

Drop an .mp4/.mov onto the Voice Manager's drop zone (or pick one via
Click to Upload) and the app diarizes it, shows the detected speakers with
previews, and lets the user pick one as a new custom voice — no audio
tooling required. One-shot scope (user-directed, no v2 holdbacks):

- Video routes to a new `.extractVoice` import step hosting
  `VoiceFromVideoView`, which drives a dedicated `SpeakerIsolatorViewModel`
  (constructed by ContentView's `makeIsolatorVM` factory) through
  load → diarize → [separate] → isolate. Audio files keep the direct flow.
- **Background stripping is always on, no toggle:** the VM runs with
  `audioPreservationEnabled = true`, so picked speech comes from the
  HTDemucs vocals stem whenever the model is installed. Phase 7 guardrail
  honored — the 287 MB model never auto-downloads; when missing, the
  existing soft-fallback banner (`SeparationStatusBanner`) surfaces the
  Manage Separation Models sheet and extraction proceeds from the mix.
- **Number of Speakers stepper + Re-detect** included in the picker step
  (same merge-down semantics as the full Diarization Settings panel).
- Picker rows reuse `MiniAudioPlayer` (with the SpeakerRow content-
  fingerprint `.id` trick so Re-detect can't leave a stale preview).
- "Use This Voice" → `VoiceReferenceExtractor.extractReference`: exact-zero
  gap stripping (run-length-gated at 50 ms so lone zero-crossing samples
  don't fragment segments), 5 ms linear crossfades at joins (hard cuts
  click and poison the KV bake), 30 s cap (PocketTTSVoiceEncoder uses at
  most the first 15 s) → temp WAV → the standard Save Voice Preset flow
  (naming, optional LavaSR, encode queue) unchanged.

Tests: VoiceReferenceExtractorTests (9) — run detection incl. the lone-
zero-sample case, gap removal, crossfade continuity, caps, degenerate
inputs, single-segment passthrough.

## WP-VMI-1 — Voice Manager import hardening (queue + gates + orphans)

**Status:** COMPLETE (user-validated — rapid adds, recovery section, and
the taller sheet all confirmed working). Follow-on Voice Manager feature
work is a separate upcoming WP (user to specify).

User-reported after rapid-adding ~10 voices back-to-back on 2026-07-15:
"King Fish" / "King Arthur" errored as name collisions on re-import while
appearing absent from the UI; disk forensics showed both HAD catalog rows —
King Arthur was left missing its Pocket-TTS KV because **every new import
cancelled the previous voice's encode** (single-slot
`inFlightVoiceImportTask` in ContentView with cancel-on-new), and the Voice
Manager recovery pass had the same flaw (one `onEncodeVoice` per incomplete
voice in a loop, each cancelling the one before → exactly ONE voice healed
per app session).

Five-part fix:

1. **Serial FIFO encode queue** (`Engine/TTS/VoiceImportQueue.swift`,
   `@MainActor @Observable`, executor-injected so mechanics are unit-tested
   without Core ML). Jobs for different voices run FIFO; enqueueing for a
   voice with pending/active work supersedes only THAT voice's job (keeps
   the old double-click-Enhance / reject-then-re-encode semantics);
   `cancel(voiceID:)` is per-voice. Fish unloads once per drained batch.
   ContentView's two duplicated pipeline closures collapsed into one
   `runVoiceImportJob`.
2. **Recovery heals everything in one pass** — `verifyAndEncodeVoices` now
   feeds the queue, so ALL incomplete voices re-encode on one Voice Manager
   open.
3. **Enhancement-Studio dismissal gate** — closing the sheet mid-
   enhancing/comparison no longer silently auto-accepts the un-auditioned
   enhancement; it cancels in-flight work, drops the candidate enhancement,
   and re-encodes the voice from its ORIGINAL audio (the voice itself stays
   — it was saved at the naming gate). At the settings step (nothing run
   yet) close = the existing Cancel semantics.
4. **WAV-only orphan recovery** — `scanForOrphans` pass 2 surfaces readable
   UUID-named WAVs with no catalog row and no valid KV ("re-encode" badge);
   adoption creates the row and queues the encode. Covers the 3 stray WAVs
   found on disk (leaked by pre-fix failed imports).
5. **Import failure hygiene** — `importVoice` deletes the copied WAV if
   convert/normalize throws, so no new row-less WAVs get minted.

RESIDUAL (accepted, documented): quitting the APP mid-enhancement still
leaves `isEnhanced=true` + the enhanced WAV on disk; the next recovery pass
encodes from that enhanced audio without an audition. Rare, self-consistent
result; revisit only if it bites.

## WP-VIT-1 — Pace-mismatch clipping + WSOLA onset artifacts

**Status:** COMPLETE (user-validated). Five-part fix on
`revoice-pace-quality`: onset guard, WSOLA natural-continuation alignment,
elastic chaining bounded to +0.35 s, best-of-N re-synthesis for takes that
would clip (>1.60× of target, up to 3 takes, keep shortest), and the
paced-target gate (compress toward `min(slot, span + 0.35 s)` so segment ENDS
are bounded like their starts — fixes the year-tail / last-segment drift).
QA loop hardened: early-exit when a finer cap measures worse; a clean first
pass with >10 % drops still gets one refinement attempt. Final measured
state on the 3-speaker test clip: best-on-record across the board —
77 matched / 12 dropped / max 0.70 s / 90th-pct 0.556 s / trend ~0.16 s/min,
zero clip-with-fade events in the kept renders.

RESIDUAL (accepted, documented): on a voice fundamentally ~1.5–2× slower
than the original speaker, the chaining budget saturates at +0.35 s and
overshoots beyond 1.60× still clip (observed up to 3.2×). Bounded chaining
cannot absorb unbounded pace debt — the eventual answer is the per-voice
pace-profiling idea below (warn/steer when a chosen voice can't keep up).

Two coupled problems when the chosen TTS voice speaks slower than the original
speaker:

1. **Clipped words (pace OFF, or overshoot > 1.60×).** When a synthesized
   segment overruns its slot by more than the WSOLA gate cap, the renderer
   falls back to clip-with-fade and genuinely discards words. Measured on a
   3-speaker test clip: `seg 11/15: slot=1.20s synth=2.48s overshoot=2.07x`
   → roughly half the synth cut. This is the main source of truly-missing
   words in re-voiced output.
2. **Scratchy/robotic voice onsets (pace ON).** USER-OBSERVED: WSOLA
   compression makes the FRONT of each re-voiced line sound scratchy and
   robotic, normalizing mid-to-end of the line. Pace ON currently *sounds*
   worse than pace OFF despite measurably tighter timing (Parakeet-native
   max drift 0.40 s vs 0.64 s). Onset transients are where time-compression
   damage is most audible.

Candidate approaches (evaluate, don't assume):
- Onset-protected compression: leave the first ~150–250 ms of each segment
  uncompressed, absorb the ratio in the vowel/steady-state region.
- Better time-scale modification than WSOLA (phase-vocoder family) for
  ratios in the 1.3–2.0× range.
- Upstream fix: faster TTS pacing per segment (if the engine's sampling
  supports a rate control) instead of post-hoc compression.
- Let overshooting segments spill into following silence when the next
  segment is far away (slot already extends to next start; consider
  same-speaker lookahead beyond it).
- Per-voice pace profiling: warn/steer when the chosen voice's natural pace
  is fundamentally incompatible with the original speaker.

Decide the `matchOriginalPace` default AFTER the artifacts are fixed —
currently it's a genuine timing-vs-quality tradeoff the user must pick.

## WP-VIT-2 — Sub-word segmentation polish (gap splits + punctuation)

**Status:** COMPLETE (user-validated — "1983 sounded perfect").
Backward-attach for fragments + punctuation on gap splits, endSec no longer
dragged across silences by punctuation timestamps, and number-run cap
protection with FULL-WORD LOOKAHEAD (Parakeet word-start tokens are usually
word prefixes — "three" arrives as " th"+"ree" — so the number test
assembles the whole incoming word before the wordlist check; diagnosed via
the `[Revoicer.tokens]` raw-token dump added to the QA loop).

The cap split now defers to word-start tokens (done, tested), but GAP splits
can still fragment words, and punctuation tokens with unreliable timestamps
can lead segments (synthetic examples of two observed patterns):
- `compli | cated` — the ASR can emit a >0.3 s timing gap BETWEEN the
  sub-word tokens of one word; the natural gap split then severs it and
  TTS speaks "cated…" as a fragment.
- `. Later that evening` — a sentence-final period token can carry the
  NEXT phrase's timestamp, so a segment starts with stray punctuation.

Fix shape: backward-attach non-word-start tokens on gap splits (append token
to the closing segment, then split before the next word-start token).
CAUTION (found in design): a naive "gap splits only at word starts" rule lets
a segment absorb long silences and swallow the following sentence — the
attach must close the segment immediately, not merely defer the split.

## WP-VIT-3 — In-app video editor (background preservation, the real fix)

**Status:** Idea / not scoped (user-requested, "later")

Programmatic background preservation under re-voiced speech is fundamentally
limited (HTDemucs separates *music*, not ambience entangled with the voice;
the duck experiment was rejected — original-voice bleed is worse than
silence). The user's direction: an in-app editor surface where the separated
tracks (background stem, per-speaker tracks, new voice tracks) are stacked on
a timeline and the user resolves conflicts manually, like Final Cut/Movavi.
Big feature — scope in its own session.

## WP-VIT-4 — Cleanup

**Status:** Not started

- Delete dead `pyannoteClusterDistanceThreshold` + stale pyannote doc
  comments in `DiarizationProvider.swift` (guard the 3 tests that assert on
  it).
- Consider FluidAudio's offline pipeline (KMeans/VBx + extra Core ML models)
  only if force-UP speaker count (splitting into more speakers than detected)
  is ever needed; merge-down covers today's use.

---

## Completed on `voice-isolation-tuning` (pending user validation / merge)

- Change Voices re-entry guard: synchronous `.preparingRevoice` status —
  first click disables the button + shows spinner; rapid taps can't spawn
  duplicate pipelines.
- Sensitivity slider remap: compensates FluidAudio's internal ×1.2, removes
  the >1.0 "never split" dead zone; slider centre preserves stock behavior.
- "Re-detect speakers": diarize-only re-run on cached audio/beds — no full
  pipeline re-run to tune sensitivity/count.
- Post-hoc phantom-speaker merge (auto) + speaker-DB reset per diarize
  (fixes cross-run accumulation).
- "Number of Speakers" made real: agglomerative merge-down to the forced
  count (merge-only; never fabricates speakers).
- Diarization end-pad (+0.5 s clamped) — recaptures VAD-trimmed sentence
  tails (utterance-final words verified captured in STT + render logs).
- Re-voice drift fix: 1.5 s STT segment cap (word-boundary splits only) —
  drift trend 2.31 → ~0.1 s/min, 90th-pct offset 1.50 → 0.28 s (pace on).
- Timing-QA adaptive re-render loop (Parakeet vs Parakeet, dev-log only):
  caps 1.5 → 1.0 → 0.7 s, keeps tightest render; verified catching + fixing
  a 0.72 s drift live.
- Python verification harness `tools/verify_revoice_timing.py` (independent
  Whisper-based cross-check; word-drift plot + dropped-tail report).
- Rejected: background duck under re-voiced speech (0.15 keep) — reverted;
  original-voice bleed judged worse than background silence.
